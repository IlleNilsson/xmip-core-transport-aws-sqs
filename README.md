# xmip-core-transport-aws-sqs

Amazon SQS transport: Signature Version 4 over the Query API — send a Stream as a message, receive with long polling and delete each message once it is a Stream — a queue URL is a Location. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

Signature Version 4 and the Query API come from [xmip-core-transport-aws](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport-aws), where every AWS technology shares what AWS speaks over HTTP (ADR-0044, amendment 2026-09-24); HTTP itself comes from [xmip-core-transport-http](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport-http).

A Stream is bytes and SQS carries a message body as text (ADR-0038, amendment 2026-09-26): the transport takes and hands up bytes, and turns them into UTF-8 text only on the wire. A payload that is not UTF-8 of the characters XML permits is refused at send with the reason, never replaced.

Requests go on connections kept between them (`http::endpoint::Connections`, offering HTTP/1.1): the transport holds them and hands them to every client it makes, so a call costs one exchange and not a connect, a TLS handshake and a `Connection: close`, as it did until 2026-09-27.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain for the whole estate. Do not change it
here.

## Verification

The included workflow is manual-only and calls the versioned shared workflow at
`IlleNilsson/.github@v1`.
